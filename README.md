# CraftyPlus (Classic WoW 1.12 Addon)

This addon provides a streamlined interface for listing, filtering, and linking your professions. Originally developed by **[shirsig](https://github.com/shirsig/crafty)** for Vanilla (1.12), CraftyPlus allows you to:

- Quickly search for recipes or reagents  
- Filter by materials on hand  
- Easily link materials in chat  
- Mark favorite recipes and filter them  
- Streamline your crafting experience  

## Turtle WoW Fix

**Turtle WoW** displays more visible rows in the profession window (e.g., 23), whereas the original addon only accounted for 8. This mismatch caused right-click (to favorite) and left-click (to select) to fail beyond the first few items.  

## Usage

- **Open a profession window** (e.g., Blacksmithing) to see Crafty’s search bar and filtering buttons.  
- **Right-click** on a recipe in the list to favorite/unfavorite it.  
- **Hold ALT** to temporarily show all recipes (bypassing your favorites filter).  
- **Use the “Mats” button** to filter by recipes you can craft immediately with on-hand reagents.
